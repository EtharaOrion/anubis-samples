"""The Relay batch-inference scorer, rebuilt to the archive's settlements.

Usage: python3 scorer.py BATCH_JSON BOARD_JSON

Reads the batch document from BATCH_JSON, writes the scoreboard and the rows it
produced to BOARD_JSON, exits 0. Whole-number arithmetic throughout; standard
library only; no file is read or written other than the two named on the command
line, and nothing under the archive directory is opened.

Settlements carried here (the lost sections of the scoring notes):

  §3 winning class on a tie for the largest logit -> the highest class id
  §4 abstain floor applied after the item is routed  -> "after_route"
  §5 the routing is driven from the items relation   -> drive "items"
  §6 a bucket left with no surviving item is omitted -> "omit"
  §7 the reported mean rounds halves to even         -> half_even
  §8 confidence is the sum of the winning logits     -> "top_sum"
  §9 a blank mean sorts last; equal means order by
     their largest join identifier, ascending        -> "nulls_last",
                                                       "by_join_id_asc"
